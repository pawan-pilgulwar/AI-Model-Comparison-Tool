# 🤖 AI Model Comparison Tool

## 📌 Project Overview
AI Model Comparison Tool is a web-based application that helps users compare different AI/ML and Large Language Models (LLMs) based on performance, cost, speed, and use-case suitability.

The system uses Generative AI to provide **intelligent, human-friendly recommendations** instead of static comparisons.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of AI models, developers and students often struggle to choose the right model for their specific needs. Existing resources are scattered, technical, and time-consuming to analyze.

This project aims to **simplify model selection** using GenAI-powered reasoning and comparison.

---

## 💡 Solution
The platform allows users to:
- Select two or more AI models
- Choose a task (chatbot, coding, summarization, etc.)
- Receive an AI-generated comparison and recommendation instantly

---

## 🧩 IPO Model

### 🟢 Input
- Model A (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude)
- Model B (optional)
- Task type (chatbot, coding, summarization, etc.)
- User query (optional)

### 🔵 Processing
- Fetches predefined, compressed benchmark and feature data
- Uses Generative AI to analyze model strengths and weaknesses
- Applies contextual reasoning based on the selected task

### 🟣 Output
- Comparison table (accuracy, cost, speed, suitability)
- AI-generated explanation
- Final recommendation
